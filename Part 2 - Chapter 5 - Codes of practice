**30 Online safety objectives**

```
(1) OFCOM must ensure that steps described in the codes of practice prepared
under section 29 are compatible with pursuit of the online safety objectives.
```
```
(2) The online safety objectives for regulated user-to-user services are—
(a) to design and operate a service in such a way that—
(i) the systems and processes for regulatory compliance and risk
management are effective and proportionate to the size and
nature of the service,
(ii) the systems and processes are appropriate to deal with the
number of users of the service and its user base,
(iii) United Kingdom users (including children) are made aware of,
and can understand, the terms of service,
(iv) there are adequate systems and processes to support United
Kingdom users,
(v) the service provides a higher standard of protection for children
than for adults,
(vi) the different needs of children at different ages are taken into
account,
(vii) there are adequate controls over access to the service by adults,
and
(viii) there are adequate controls over access to, and use of, the
service by children, taking into account use of the service by,
and impact on, children in different age groups; and
(b) to design and assess the service with a view to protecting United
Kingdom users from harm, including with regard to—
(i) algorithms used by the service,
(ii) functionalities of the service, and
(iii) other features relating to the operation of the service.
```
```
(3) The online safety objectives for regulated search services are—
(a) to design and operate a service in such a way that—
(i) the systems and processes for regulatory compliance and risk
management are effective and proportionate to the size and
nature of the service,
(ii) the systems and processes are appropriate to deal with the
number of users of the service and its user base,
(iii) United Kingdom users (including children) are made aware of,
and can understand, the publicly available statement referred to
in sections 21 and 22,
(iv) there are adequate systems and processes to support United
Kingdom users,
(v) the service provides a higher standard of protection for children
than for adults, and
(vi) the different needs of children at different ages are taken into
account;
(b) to assess use of the service by, and impact on, children in different age
groups; and
(c) to design and assess the search engine with a view to protecting United
Kingdom users from harm, including with regard to—
(i) algorithms used by the search engine,
(ii) functionalities relating to searches (such as a predictive search
functionality), and
(iii) the indexing, organisation and presentation of search results.
```
```
(4) In the case of a regulated user-to-user service that includes a search engine, the
online safety objectives set out in subsection (3) apply in relation to the search
engine (and accordingly references in that subsection to a search service are to
be read as references to the search engine).
(5) The Secretary of State may by regulations amend subsection (2) or (3) so as to
vary the online safety objectives for regulated user-to-user services or
regulated search services.
```
```
(6) If regulations are made amending the online safety objectives, OFCOM must,
as soon as reasonably practicable afterwards, consider whether a review of the
codes of practice published under section 34 is required and, if OFCOM
consider that it is required, carry out a review to assess whether any
amendments are needed to reflect the revised objectives.
```
```
(7) See section 36(8) and (9) for further provision about the online safety objectives.
```
**31 Further provision about codes of practice**

```
(1) In preparing a code of practice or amendments under section 29, OFCOM
must—
(a) consider the appropriateness of provisions of the code of practice to
different kinds and sizes of regulated services and to providers of
differing kinds, sizes and capacities;
(b) have regard to the following principles—
(i) the principle that providers of regulated services must be able
to understand which provisions of the code of practice apply in
relation to a particular service they provide;
(ii) the principle that the steps described in the code of practice
must be sufficiently clear, and at a sufficiently detailed level,
that providers understand what those steps entail in practice;
(iii) the principle that the steps described in the code of practice
must be proportionate and feasible, recognising that steps that
are proportionate or feasible for providers of a certain kind, size
or capacity may not be proportionate or feasible for providers of
a different kind, size or capacity;
(iv) the principle that the steps described in the code of practice that
apply in relation to regulated services of various kinds and sizes
must be proportionate to OFCOM’s assessment (under section
61) of the risk of harm presented by services of that kind or size.
```
```
(2) A code of practice under section 29 may—
(a) make different provision with regard to—
(i) regulated user-to-user services, and
(ii) regulated search services;
(b) make different provision with regard to regulated user-to-user services
of different kinds or regulated search services of different kinds; and
(c) otherwise differentiate between regulated services, and between
providers of regulated services, in such manner as OFCOM consider
appropriate.
```
```
(3) A code of practice under section 29 may apply in relation to a person who
provides a regulated service from outside the United Kingdom.
```
```
(4) Steps described in a code of practice under section 29 may relate only to the
design or operation of a regulated service—
(a) in the United Kingdom, or
(b) as it affects United Kingdom users of the service.

(5) Steps described in a code of practice under section 29 which are recommended
for the purposes of compliance with any of the relevant duties must be
designed in the light of the principles mentioned in subsection (6) and (where
appropriate) incorporate safeguards for the protection of the matters
mentioned in the principles.
```
```
(6) The principles are—
(a) the importance of protecting the right of users and (in the case of search
services) interested persons to freedom of expression within the law,
and
(b) the importance of protecting users from unwarranted infringements of
privacy.
```
```
(7) In this section “the relevant duties” has the meaning given by section 29(9).

about a particular step recommended to be taken by providers of
regulated services, and

acting otherwise than by taking a step described in a code of practice which is
recommended for the purposes of compliance with the duty must have regard
