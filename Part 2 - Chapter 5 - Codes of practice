**30 Online safety objectives**


(1) OFCOM must ensure that steps described in the codes of practice prepared
under section 29 are compatible with pursuit of the online safety objectives.


(2) The online safety objectives for regulated user-to-user services are—
(a) to design and operate a service in such a way that—
(i) the systems and processes for regulatory compliance and risk
management are effective and proportionate to the size and
nature of the service,
(ii) the systems and processes are appropriate to deal with the
number of users of the service and its user base,
(iii) United Kingdom users (including children) are made aware of,
and can understand, the terms of service,
(iv) there are adequate systems and processes to support United
Kingdom users,
(v) the service provides a higher standard of protection for children
than for adults,
(vi) the different needs of children at different ages are taken into
account,
(vii) there are adequate controls over access to the service by adults,
and
(viii) there are adequate controls over access to, and use of, the
service by children, taking into account use of the service by,
and impact on, children in different age groups; and
(b) to design and assess the service with a view to protecting United
Kingdom users from harm, including with regard to—
(i) algorithms used by the service,
(ii) functionalities of the service, and
(iii) other features relating to the operation of the service.


(3) The online safety objectives for regulated search services are—
(a) to design and operate a service in such a way that—
(i) the systems and processes for regulatory compliance and risk
management are effective and proportionate to the size and
nature of the service,
(ii) the systems and processes are appropriate to deal with the
number of users of the service and its user base,
(iii) United Kingdom users (including children) are made aware of,
and can understand, the publicly available statement referred to
in sections 21 and 22,
(iv) there are adequate systems and processes to support United
Kingdom users,
(v) the service provides a higher standard of protection for children
than for adults, and
(vi) the different needs of children at different ages are taken into
account;
(b) to assess use of the service by, and impact on, children in different age
groups; and
(c) to design and assess the search engine with a view to protecting United
Kingdom users from harm, including with regard to—
(i) algorithms used by the search engine,
(ii) functionalities relating to searches (such as a predictive search
functionality), and
(iii) the indexing, organisation and presentation of search results.


(4) In the case of a regulated user-to-user service that includes a search engine, the
online safety objectives set out in subsection (3) apply in relation to the search
engine (and accordingly references in that subsection to a search service are to
be read as references to the search engine).
(5) The Secretary of State may by regulations amend subsection (2) or (3) so as to
vary the online safety objectives for regulated user-to-user services or
regulated search services.


(6) If regulations are made amending the online safety objectives, OFCOM must,
as soon as reasonably practicable afterwards, consider whether a review of the
codes of practice published under section 34 is required and, if OFCOM
consider that it is required, carry out a review to assess whether any
amendments are needed to reflect the revised objectives.


(7) See section 36(8) and (9) for further provision about the online safety objectives.

**31 Further provision about codes of practice**


(1) In preparing a code of practice or amendments under section 29, OFCOM
must—
(a) consider the appropriateness of provisions of the code of practice to
different kinds and sizes of regulated services and to providers of
differing kinds, sizes and capacities;
(b) have regard to the following principles—
(i) the principle that providers of regulated services must be able
to understand which provisions of the code of practice apply in
relation to a particular service they provide;
(ii) the principle that the steps described in the code of practice
must be sufficiently clear, and at a sufficiently detailed level,
that providers understand what those steps entail in practice;
(iii) the principle that the steps described in the code of practice
must be proportionate and feasible, recognising that steps that
are proportionate or feasible for providers of a certain kind, size
or capacity may not be proportionate or feasible for providers of
a different kind, size or capacity;
(iv) the principle that the steps described in the code of practice that
apply in relation to regulated services of various kinds and sizes
must be proportionate to OFCOM’s assessment (under section
61) of the risk of harm presented by services of that kind or size.


(2) A code of practice under section 29 may—
(a) make different provision with regard to—
(i) regulated user-to-user services, and
(ii) regulated search services;
(b) make different provision with regard to regulated user-to-user services
of different kinds or regulated search services of different kinds; and
(c) otherwise differentiate between regulated services, and between
providers of regulated services, in such manner as OFCOM consider
appropriate.


(3) A code of practice under section 29 may apply in relation to a person who
provides a regulated service from outside the United Kingdom.


(4) Steps described in a code of practice under section 29 may relate only to the
design or operation of a regulated service—
(a) in the United Kingdom, or
(b) as it affects United Kingdom users of the service.

(5) Steps described in a code of practice under section 29 which are recommended
for the purposes of compliance with any of the relevant duties must be
designed in the light of the principles mentioned in subsection (6) and (where
appropriate) incorporate safeguards for the protection of the matters
mentioned in the principles.


(6) The principles are—
(a) the importance of protecting the right of users and (in the case of search
services) interested persons to freedom of expression within the law,
and
(b) the importance of protecting users from unwarranted infringements of
privacy.


(7) In this section “the relevant duties” has the meaning given by section 29(9).

requiring OFCOM to modify the code of practice for the reasons mentioned in
paragraph (a) or (b) of subsection (1), and subsections (2) and (3) apply again
in relation to any such further direction.


(5) When the Secretary of State is satisfied that no further modifications to the code

(6) The Secretary of State may at any time require OFCOM to review a code of
practice prepared under section 29(1) or (2).

**35 Minor amendments of codes of practice**


(1) This section applies if—
(a) OFCOM propose to prepare amendments of a code of practice under
section 29, and
(b) OFCOM consider that the minor nature of the amendments means
that—
(i) consultation is unnecessary, and
(ii) the amendments (once prepared) should not be required to be
laid before Parliament.


(2) OFCOM must notify the Secretary of State of OFCOM’s proposed
amendments.


(3) If the Secretary of State agrees with OFCOM that it is appropriate—

#### EXPLANATORY NOTES FOR THIS SECTION

Chapter 5: Codes of practice

Clause 29: Codes of practice about duties

OFCOM is required to produce specific codes of practice in relation to the
illegal content duties (set out in clauses 9 and 21) covering terrorist content
(subsection (1)) and child sexual exploitation and abuse content (subsection (2)).
Subsection (3) requires OFCOM to prepare one or more codes of practice in
relation to the relevant safety duties beyond those set out in subsections (1) and (2).
How these codes should be structured and organised will be a matter for OFCOM to
decide as appropriate. The codes of practice will set out the recommended steps that
service providers can take to comply with the following relevant duties (see
subsection (9)):
a. the safety duties for user-to-user services and search services;
These explanatory notes relate to the Online Safety Bill as published in draft on 12 May 2021 (Bill CP 405)
b. the duties about democratic importance;
c. the duties about journalistic content; and
d. the duties about user reporting and redress.
To ensure the codes of practice stay up to date, subsection (4) allows
OFCOM to prepare amendments and replacements to the codes of practice or to
withdraw a code of practice.
When preparing codes of practice or amendments to them, subsection (5)
sets out the parties whom OFCOM must consult. OFCOM must also consult those
with expertise in national security or the enforcement of criminal law which is relevant
to online safety matters dealing with illegal content (subsections (6) and (7)).
Subsection (8) sets out that the consultation requirements in subsections (5)
and (6) are subject to exceptions where minor amendments are made to the codes of
practice (as set out in clause 35).
Clause 30: Online safety objectives

Subsection (1) requires OFCOM to ensure that its codes of practice are
compatible with the online safety objectives.
Subsection (2) sets out the objectives for user-to-user services and
subsection (3) does the same for search services. For both types of services, the
objectives set out that services are required to put in place effective and
proportionate systems and processes for regulatory compliance and risk
management. The objectives also set out that the functions and features of regulated
services must be designed and operated to protect UK users from harm.
Subsection (4) makes provision for user-to-user services which include
search services, providing that the objectives for search services apply to the search
aspect of the user-to-user service.
Subsection (5) gives the Secretary of State a power to amend subsection (2)
or (3) so as to vary the online safety objectives for regulated user-to-user services or
regulated search services, by regulations. Should such amendments be made,
subsection (6) obliges OFCOM, as soon as reasonably practicable, to consider
whether a review of the codes of practice is required, and if any subsequent changes
to the codes are needed following a review. Regulations made under this power are
subject to the affirmative regulation procedure.
Clause 36(7) and (8) make further provisions about the role of the online
safety objectives in relation to a service provider’s compliance with the relevant
duties. Providers who wish to comply with the duties in a way other than the steps set
out in the codes of practice must have regard to the online safety objectives. On the
issue of whether alternative steps taken by a provider are compliant, OFCOM is
under a duty to consider the extent to which the alternative steps taken by the
provider achieve the online safety objectives (so far as they are relevant to the
service and the duty in question).
These explanatory notes relate to the Online Safety Bill as published in draft on 12 May 2021 (Bill CP 405)
Clause 31: Further provision about codes of practice

Subsection (1)(a) requires OFCOM to consider how appropriate the steps
within codes of practice are for the different kinds and sizes of regulated services and
to different kinds, sizes and capacities of providers. Paragraph (b) then sets out
various principles that OFCOM must follow when preparing a code of practice.
Subsection (2) allows codes of practice to make provisions that are different
for user-to-user and search service providers, and to make different provisions for
different types of user-to-user providers. It also allows OFCOM to differentiate
between regulated services and between providers, as appropriate.
Subsection (3) provides that codes of practice can apply to providers based
outside of the United Kingdom.
Subsection (4) provides that steps set out in a code of practice may only
relate to the design or operation of regulated services as they affect users and others
in the United Kingdom. This means that OFCOM could not set out steps which relate
to the design or operation of services which do not affect UK users.
Steps within the codes of practice must be designed with the importance of
users’ rights to free expression and privacy in mind, and incorporate safeguards for
these rights, where appropriate: see subsections (5) and (6).
Clause 32: Approval of codes of practice

The next three clauses set out the procedural requirements for approval and
publication of the codes of practice.
Subsections (1) and (2) set out that OFCOM must submit a code of practice
to the Secretary of State, and provided the Secretary of State does not intend to
issue a direction to OFCOM (see clause 33), the Secretary of State must lay the
code before Parliament.
Subsection (3) provides that, once the code of practice has been laid before
Parliament, Parliament has 40 days to resolve not to approve it. If Parliament
resolves not to approve the code of practice, OFCOM must not issue the code and
must prepare another version of it.
Subsection (4) provides that if Parliament does not make such a resolution,
OFCOM must issue the code of practice and it will come into force after 21 days
(beginning on the day on which it is issued).
Subsection (5) defines “the 40-day period” in which Parliament may resolve
not to approve the code or practice. This period is defined as starting when the code
has been placed before both Houses of Parliament. Subsection (6) further specifies
that in calculating this period, days when Parliament is dissolved or prorogued or
both Houses are adjourned for more than 4 days should not be taken into account.
Subsection (7) provides that this clause applies to amendments to a code of
practice prepared under clause 29. Subsection (8) provides that this clause is subject
These explanatory notes relate to the Online Safety Bill as published in draft on 12 May 2021 (Bill CP 405)
to clause 35, which sets out the process for making minor amendments to codes of
practice.
Clause 33: Secretary of State’s power of direction

Subsection (1) confers a power on the Secretary of State to direct OFCOM to
modify a code of practice submitted to the Secretary of State under clause 32(1).
This subsection further specifies that the Secretary of State may use this power if
they believe that modifications are required to reflect government policy; or, in
respect of the child sexual exploitation and abuse and terrorism codes only, for
reasons of national security or public safety.
Subsection (2)(a) qualifies this power of the Secretary of State by providing
that a direction made under this clause cannot require OFCOM to include a particular
step recommended to be taken by providers of regulated services in a code of
practice. Subsection (2)(b) further qualifies this power by providing that the Secretary
of State must give reasons for requiring modifications, except where setting out those
reasons would be against the interests of national security or the UK’s relations with
the government of another country.
Subsection (3) provides that OFCOM must as soon as reasonably practicable
comply with a direction made under this clause and sets out the steps that OFCOM
must take when sending the modified code back to the Secretary of State. OFCOM
would be required to submit a document to the Secretary of State containing details
of the direction and changes that have been made to the code of practice as a result
of the direction. OFCOM must also inform the Secretary of State of any modifications
that have been made that are not in response to a direction.
Subsection (4) provides that the Secretary of State may make further
directions. Any further directions must also be issued for one of the reasons set out in
subsection (1) and the requirements in subsections (2) and (3) will apply.
Under subsection (5), once the Secretary of State is content that no further
modifications are necessary, they must as soon as reasonably practicable lay the
revised code of practice before Parliament along with any document submitted by
OFCOM that details what changes have been made to the code of practice, as
mentioned in subsection (3)(c).
Subsection (6) provides that the negative resolution procedure set out in
subsections (3) to (6) of clause 32 also applies in relation to modified codes of
practice that have been laid before Parliament in accordance with subsection (5).
Subsection (7) provides that the process set out in this clause also applies to
amendments to a code of practice submitted to the Secretary of State under clause
Clause 34: Publication and review of codes of practice

This clause sets out what OFCOM must do once a code is ready for
publication. Subsection (1) provides that OFCOM must publish a code of practice
issued under clause 32 within 3 days of it being issued.
These explanatory notes relate to the Online Safety Bill as published in draft on 12 May 2021 (Bill CP 405)
Subsection (2) provides that where amendments of a code of practice have
been issued, OFCOM must publish the amended code within 3 days beginning with
the day on which the amendments are issued.
Subsection (3) applies when a code of practice has been withdrawn, and
requires OFCOM to publish a notice setting out that the code has been withdrawn.
Subsection (4) provides that publication of a code of practice under this
clause must be in any manner that OFCOM considers appropriate.
Subsection (5) provides that OFCOM must keep each code of practice
published under this clause under review, and subsection (6) provides that the
Secretary of State may require a review by OFCOM of either the terrorism or the
child sexual exploitation and abuse (CSEA) code of practice at any time under
section 29(1) or (2), and if any amendments are required this will be subject to the
process for amendments as provided in clause 29.
Clause 35: Minor amendments of codes of practice

This clause allows OFCOM to make minor amendments to the codes of
practice (for example to reflect the changes of the name of a relevant organisation)
without needing to comply with the requirements for consultation and parliamentary
scrutiny. This flexibility should allow the codes to remain up-to-date.
Subsection (1) explains that this clause applies when OFCOM proposes
amendments to a code of practice and OFCOM considers that the minor nature of
the amendments means that consultation is unnecessary and the amendments
should not be required to be laid before Parliament.
Subsection (2) provides that OFCOM must notify the Secretary of State of
these proposed amendments. Subsections (3) provides that, if the Secretary of State
agrees that it is appropriate, the amendments may be made and issued without
complying with the requirements of clause 29(5) and (6) or clause 32. This means
that OFCOM does not have to consult on the proposed changes and the amended
codes do not need to be laid before Parliament.
Subsection (4) provides that if the Secretary of State agrees with OFCOM
that the changes are minor and do not require consultation or to be laid before
Parliament, OFCOM may prepare and issue the amendments of the code of practice.
Subsection (5) provides that amendments issued under this clause come into
force at the end of 21 days, beginning with the day on which the amendments are
issued.
Subsection (6) provides that amendments of a code of practice issued under
this clause must be published within three days of issue.
Clause 36: Relationship between duties and codes of practice

This clause sets out how providers can comply with their relevant duties
under this Bill.
These explanatory notes relate to the Online Safety Bill as published in draft on 12 May 2021 (Bill CP 405)

Subsection (1) provides that a provider of a regulated user-to-user service will
be treated as complying with their safety duties for protecting children and adults,
reporting and redress duties, and duties related to journalistic content and democratic
content if it takes the steps set out in the relevant codes of practice which are
recommended for compliance with the duty in question.
Subsection (2) provides that, in relation to the safety duties for illegal content,
a provider of a regulated user-to-user service will be treated as having complied with
them if it has taken the recommended steps and OFCOM is also satisfied that
terrorist content and CSEA content are not prevalent, and are not persistently
present, on its services.
Subsection (3) provides that a provider of a regulated search service is to be
treated as complying with its safety duties in relation to children and reporting and
redress duties if the provider takes the relevant steps described in a code of practice
which are recommended for the purposes of compliance with the duty in question.
Subsection (4) provides that a provider of a regulated search service is to be
treated as compliant with the safety duties about illegal content if it takes the relevant
steps described in the codes of practice that are recommended for the purposes of
compliance with the duty in question. In addition, OFCOM must be satisfied that
terrorism and CSEA content is not prevalent, and is not persistently present, in the
search results of the search service.
Subsection (5) specifies when a provider of a regulated user-to-user service
is to be treated as complying with the duty set out in clause 12(2) (which is to have
regard to the importance of freedom of expression and privacy when implementing
safety policies and procedures). A provider will be treated as complying with this duty
if they take steps described in a code of practice that are recommended for
compliance with their safety duties which incorporate safeguards for the protection of
users’ rights to freedom of expression or the protection of users from unwarranted
infringements of privacy.
Subsection (6) specifies when a provider of a regulated search service is to
be treated as complying with the duty set out in clause 23(2) (which is a duty to have
regard to the importance of freedom of expression and privacy when deciding on and
implementing safety policies and procedure). A provider will be treated as complying
with this duty if they take steps described in a code of practice that are recommended
for compliance with their safety duties which incorporate safeguards for the
protection of the rights of users and interested persons to freedom of expression or
the protection of users from unwarranted infringements of privacy.
Subsection (7) provides that non-compliance with a provision in a code of
practice does not by itself make the provider liable to legal proceedings in a court or
a tribunal.
Subsection (8) provides that a provider of a regulated service who seeks to
comply with a relevant duty by acting otherwise than by taking a step described in a
code of practice must have regard to the following:
These explanatory notes relate to the Online Safety Bill as published in draft on 12 May 2021 (Bill CP 405)
a. The online safety objectives (in clause 30) where these are relevant to the
service and duty in question; and
b. Where relevant, the importance of protecting the rights of users (and, for
search services, interested persons) to freedom of expression and from
unwarranted infringements of privacy.
Subsection (9) provides that, when assessing whether a provider of a
regulated service is compliant with a relevant duty where they have acted otherwise
than by taking a step described in a code of practice, OFCOM must consider whether
the alternative steps taken by the provider:
a. Achieve the online safety objectives (in clause 30) so far as they are relevant
to the service and duty in question: and
b. Where appropriate, incorporate appropriate safeguards protecting the rights
of users to freedom of expression and from unwarranted infringements of
privacy.
Subsection (10) provides that in subsections (3), (4) and (6), references to a
provider of a regulated search service also include a provider of a regulated user-to-
user service that includes a search engine.
Subsection (11) defines various terms used in this clause, which are self
explanatory.
Clause 37: Effect of codes of practice

Subsection (1) provides that codes of practice can be used as evidence in
legal proceedings.
Subsection (2) provides that a court or tribunal must take into account a
provision of a code of practice, when determining a question that arises during legal
proceedings if (i) the question relates to a time when the provision was in force and,
(ii) the provision appears to the court of tribunal be relevant to the question.
Subsection (3) requires OFCOM to take into account a provision of a code of
practice, when determining a question which arises in connection with their exercise
of any relevant function (defined in subsection (4)) if (i) the question relates to a time
when the provision was in force and (ii) the provision appears to OFCOM to be
relevant to the question.
Subsection (4) is self-explanatory.
Clause 38: Duties and the first codes of practice

Subsection (1) provides that the duties identified in subsection (2) apply to
providers of regulated services from the day on which the first code of practice
relating to each duty comes into force.
Subsection (3) defines the criteria for when a code of practice is the first
relating to a duty. These are:
These explanatory notes relate to the Online Safety Bill as published in draft on 12 May 2021 (Bill CP 405)
a. It sets out the recommended steps for complying with that duty; and
b. It is the first code of practice that defines the steps for those purposes.
Subsections (4) and (5) make specific provision for the relevant duties in
relation to illegal content (as they apply to terrorism and CSEA. These duties apply
when the first codes on terrorism and CSEA come into force. Subsection (6) modifies
subsection (1) of this clause accordingly.
Subsection (7) makes clear that for particular providers of regulated services
the provisions of this clause only concern the duties which apply to them (as
specified in clause 5 for providers of user-to-user services, and in clause 17 for
providers of search services). So for example, the duty to protect content of
democratic importance will apply only to providers of Category 1 services when the
relevant code of practice comes into force.
