Provisional notices and confirmation decisions
```
**80 Provisional notice of enforcement action**

```
(1) OFCOM may, in accordance with this section, give a person a notice stating
that they intend to take enforcement action (a “provisional notice of
enforcement action”).
```
```
(2) Subject to section 81, OFCOM may give a provisional notice of enforcement
action relating to a regulated service to the provider of the service if they
consider that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the provider has
failed, or is failing, to comply with any enforceable requirement referred to in
section 82 that applies in relation to the service.
```
```
(3) OFCOM may also give a provisional notice of enforcement action to a person
on either of the grounds in subsection (4).
```
```
(4) The grounds are—
(a) the person has been given an information notice and OFCOM consider
that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the person has
failed, or is failing, to comply with either of the duties set out in section
70(10) (duties in relation to information notices), or
(b) the person is required by a skilled person appointed under section 74
to give assistance to the skilled person, and OFCOM consider that there
are reasonable grounds for believing that the person is in breach of the
duty in subsection (8) of that section to give such assistance.
```
```
(5) A provisional notice of enforcement action given to a person must—
(a) specify the duty or requirement with which (in OFCOM’s opinion) the
person has failed, or is failing, to comply,
(b) give OFCOM’s reasons for their opinion that the person has failed, or
is failing, to comply with it, and
(c) specify what steps OFCOM consider the person needs to take in order
to—
(i) comply with it, or
(ii) remedy the failure.
```
```
(6) A provisional notice of enforcement action may also state that OFCOM
propose to impose a penalty on the person, and in such a case the notice must—
(a) state the reasons why OFCOM propose to impose a penalty, and
(b) indicate the amount of the penalty that OFCOM propose to impose,
including any aggravating or mitigating factors that they propose to
take into account.
```
```
(7) A provisional notice of enforcement action given to a person must—
(a) state that the person may make written representations (with any
supporting evidence) about the matters contained in the notice, and
(b) specify the period within which such representations may be made.
```
```
(8) A provisional notice of enforcement action may be given in respect of a failure
to comply with more than one enforceable requirement.
(9) Where a provisional notice of enforcement action is given in respect of a
continuing failure, the notice may be given in respect of any period during
which the failure has continued, and must specify that period.
```
```
(10) Where a provisional notice of enforcement action is given to a person in respect
of a failure to comply with a duty or requirement (“the first notice”), a further
provisional notice of enforcement action in respect of a failure to comply with
that same duty or requirement may be given to the person only—
(a) in respect of a separate instance of the failure after the time at which the
first notice was given,
(b) where a period was specified in the first notice in accordance with
subsection (9), in respect of the continuation of the failure after the end
of that period, or
(c) if the first notice has been withdrawn without a penalty being imposed
by a confirmation decision in respect of the failure (see section 83(6)).
```
**81 Prevalent and persistent terrorism or CSEA content**

```
(1) This section applies where OFCOM consider that there are reasonable grounds
for believing that a person is failing to comply with the duty in section 9 or (as
the case may be) 21 (safety duties about illegal content), so far as relating to
terrorism content or CSEA content (or both those kinds of content), in relation
to a regulated service of which that person is the provider, based on evidence
demonstrating the prevalence, and persistent presence, of terrorism content or
CSEA content (or both)—
(a) in the case of a user-to-user service, on the service;
(b) in the case of a search service, in search results of the service.
```
```
(2) OFCOM may not give the person a provisional notice of enforcement action if
they are satisfied that the person is complying with all other enforceable
requirements referred to in section 82 that apply in relation to the service.
```
```
(3) If however OFCOM consider that there are reasonable grounds for believing
that the person has failed, or is failing, to comply with any other enforceable
requirement that applies in relation to the service, OFCOM may give the
person a provisional notice of enforcement action in relation to that failure.
```
```
(4) See section 63 for action that OFCOM may take where this section applies (use
of technology warning notice).
```
```
(5) In a case mentioned in subsection (3), OFCOM may give a person both a
provisional notice of enforcement action and a use of technology warning
notice under section 63.

fact.
```
```
(3) If the conditions in subsection (5) or (6) are met, OFCOM may give the person

```
```
(4) A confirmation decision is a notice—

(b) imposing a penalty as described in subsection (6), or
(c) doing both those things.
```
```
(5) If OFCOM are satisfied that the person—
(a) has failed, or has been failing, to comply with a notified requirement,
and

the confirmation decision may require the person to take steps to comply with
that requirement or to remedy the failure.
```
```
(6) If—
(a) the provisional notice of enforcement action states that OFCOM
propose to impose a penalty, and
(b) OFCOM are satisfied that the person has failed, or has been failing, to

```
```
(12) A confirmation decision may impose separate penalties for failure to comply

```
```
(13) Where a provisional notice of enforcement action is given in respect of a period
of continuing failure, no more than one penalty may be imposed by a
confirmation decision in respect of the period of failure specified in the
provisional notice of enforcement action.
```
```
(14) But where a confirmation decision includes a requirement as described in
subsection (5) in respect of a continuing failure, the confirmation decision may
impose a penalty in respect of each day that that same failure continues after

less than a year, the amount mentioned in subsection (7)(a) or (b) is to
be proportionately increased;
(b) if the duration of a person’s most recent complete accounting period is
more than a year, that amount is to be proportionately reduced.

yet ended, the amount that OFCOM estimate to be the group’s likely
qualifying worldwide revenue for that period.


(5) In a case where the accounting periods of the entities liable for the penalty are
different—
(a) the reference in subsection (4)(a) to the accounting period of the entities
is to be read as a reference to the accounting period of either of the
entities (at OFCOM’s discretion), and
(b) subsection (4)(b) is to apply as if—
(i) for “the first accounting period of the entities” there were
substituted “the first accounting period of both of the entities”,
and
(ii) for “that period” there were substituted “the accounting period
of either of the entities (at OFCOM’s discretion)”.

(g) in the case of an application made without notice having been given to
the non-compliant provider, or to the persons mentioned in paragraph
(d), state why no notice has been given.
```
```
(6) The court may make a service restriction order imposing requirements on a
person in relation to the relevant service if the court is satisfied—
(a) as to the grounds in subsection (3) or the grounds in subsection (4) (as
the case may be),
(b) that the person provides an ancillary service in relation to the relevant
service,
(c) that it is appropriate to make the order for the purposes of preventing
harm to individuals in the United Kingdom, and the order is
proportionate to the risk of such harm,
(d) in the case of an application made on the ground in subsection (3)(c)(iii)
or (iv), that it is appropriate to make the order before a provisional
notice of enforcement action or confirmation decision has been given,
or before compliance with a confirmation decision has been ascertained
(as the case may be), and
(e) if no notice of the application has been given to the non-compliant
provider, or to the persons on whom requirements are being imposed,
that it is appropriate to make the order without notice.
```
```
(7) When considering whether to make a service restriction order in relation to the
relevant service, and when considering what provision it should contain, the
court must take into account (amongst other things) the rights and obligations
of all relevant parties, including those of—
(a) the non-compliant provider,
(b) the person or persons on whom the court is considering imposing the
requirements, and
(c) United Kingdom users of the relevant service.
```
```
(8) A service restriction order made in relation to the relevant service must—


(a) identify the non-compliant provider,
(b) identify the persons on whom the requirements are imposed, and any
ancillary service to which the requirements relate,
(c) require such persons to take the steps specified in the order, or to put in
place arrangements, that have the effect of withdrawing the ancillary
service to the extent that it relates to the relevant service (or part of it),
or preventing the ancillary service from promoting or displaying
content that relates to the relevant service (or part of it) in any way,
(d) specify the date by which the requirements in the order must be

to the operation of the relevant service as it affects United Kingdom
users.
```
```
(10) OFCOM must inform the Secretary of State as soon as reasonably practicable
after a service restriction order has been made.
```
```
(11) For the purposes of this section, a service is an “ancillary service” in relation to

service (or part of it), whether directly or indirectly, or displays or promotes
content relating to the regulated service (or to part of it).

**92 Interim service restriction orders**

```
(1) OFCOM may apply to the court for an interim order under this section (an
“interim service restriction order”) in relation to a regulated service where
OFCOM consider that—
(a) the grounds in subsection (3) apply in relation to the service, or
(b) the grounds in subsection (4) apply in relation to the service.

(2) An interim service restriction order is an interim order imposing requirements
on one or more persons who provide an ancillary service in relation to a
regulated service (see subsection (9)).
```
```
(3) The grounds mentioned in subsection (1)(a) are that—
(a) it is likely that the provider of the regulated service is failing to comply
with an enforceable requirement referred to in section 82 that applies in
relation to the regulated service, and
(b) the level of risk of harm to individuals in the United Kingdom relating
to the likely failure, and the nature and severity of that harm, are such
that it would not be appropriate to wait to establish the failure before
applying for the order.
```
```
(4) The grounds mentioned in subsection (1)(b) are that—
(a) it is likely that the provider of the regulated service is failing to comply
with a use of technology notice under section 64, 65 or 67 that relates to
the service, and
(b) the level of risk of harm to individuals in the United Kingdom relating
to the likely failure, and the nature and severity of that harm, are such
that it would not be appropriate to wait to establish the failure before
applying for the order.
```
```
(5) An application by OFCOM for an interim service restriction order must—
(a) specify the regulated service in relation to which the application is
made (“the relevant service”),
(b) specify the provider of that service (“the non-compliant provider”),
(c) specify the grounds on which the application is based, and contain
evidence as to such grounds,
(d) specify the persons on whom (in OFCOM’s opinion) the requirements
of the order should be imposed,
(e) contain evidence as to why OFCOM consider that the persons
mentioned in paragraph (d) provide an ancillary service in relation to
the relevant service, and specify any such ancillary service provided,
(f) specify the requirements which OFCOM consider that the order should
impose on such persons, and
(g) in the case of an application made without notice having been given to
the non-compliant provider, or to the persons mentioned in paragraph
(d), state why no notice has been given.
```
```
(6) The court may make an interim service restriction order imposing
requirements on a person in relation to the relevant service if the court is
satisfied—
(a) as to the ground in subsection (3)(a) or the ground in subsection (4)(a)
(as the case may be),
(b) that the person provides an ancillary service in relation to the relevant
service,
(c) that there are prima facie grounds to suggest that an application for a
service restriction order under section 91 would be successful,
(d) that the level of risk of harm to individuals in the United Kingdom
relating to the likely failure mentioned in subsection (3)(a) or (4)(a)
(whichever applies), and the nature and severity of that harm, are such
that it is not appropriate to wait for the failure to be established before
making the order, and
(e) if no notice of the application has been given to the non-compliant
provider, or to the persons on whom requirements are being imposed,
that it is appropriate to make the order without notice.
```
```
(7) An interim service restriction order ceases to have effect on the earlier of—
(a) the date specified in the order, or the date on which the time period
specified in the order expires (as the case may be), or
(b) the date on which the court makes a service restriction order under
section 91 in relation to the relevant service that imposes requirements
on the same persons on whom requirements are imposed by the
interim order, or dismisses the application for such an order.
```
```
(8) Subsections (7) to (10) of section 91 apply in relation to an interim service
restriction order under this section as they apply in relation to a service
restriction order under that section.
```
```
(9) In this section, “ancillary service” and “the court” have the same meaning as in
section 91 (see subsections (11), (12) and (13) of that section).
```
**93 Access restriction orders**

```
(1) OFCOM may apply to the court for an order under this section (an “access
restriction order”) in relation to a regulated service where OFCOM consider
that—
(a) the grounds in section 91(3) or (4) apply in relation to the service, and
(b) either—
(i) a service restriction order under section 91 or an interim service
restriction order under section 92 has been made in relation to
the failure, and it was not sufficient to prevent significant harm
arising to individuals in the United Kingdom as a result of the
failure, or
(ii) the likely consequences of the failure are such that if a service
restriction order or an interim service restriction order were to
be made, it would be unlikely to be sufficient to prevent
significant harm arising to individuals in the United Kingdom
as a result of the failure,
and in this paragraph, “the failure” means the failure mentioned in
section 91(3)(a) or (4)(a) (as the case may be).
```
```
(2) An access restriction order is an order imposing requirements on one or more
persons who provide an access facility in relation to a regulated service (see

made (“the relevant service”),
(b) specify the provider of that service (“the non-compliant provider”),
(c) specify the grounds on which the application is based, and contain
evidence as to such grounds,
(d) specify the persons on whom (in OFCOM’s opinion) the requirements

mentioned in paragraph (d) provide an access facility in relation to the
relevant service, and specify any such access facility provided,

(f) specify the requirements which OFCOM consider that the order should
impose on such persons, and
(g) in the case of an application made without notice having been given to
the non-compliant provider, or to the persons mentioned in paragraph
(d), state why no notice has been given.
```
```
(4) The court may make an access restriction order imposing requirements on a
person in relation to the relevant service if the court is satisfied—
(a) as to the grounds in subsection (1),
(b) that the person provides an access facility in relation to the relevant
service,
(c) that it is appropriate to make the order for the purposes of preventing
significant harm to individuals in the United Kingdom, and the order
is proportionate to the risk of such harm,
(d) in the case of an application made on the ground in subsection (3)(c)(iii)
or (iv) of section 91 (by virtue of subsection (1)(a)), that it is appropriate
to make the order before a provisional notice of enforcement action or
confirmation decision has been given, or before compliance with a
confirmation decision has been ascertained (as the case may be), and
(e) if no notice of the application has been given to the non-compliant
provider, or to the persons on whom requirements are being imposed,
that it is appropriate to make the order without notice.
```
```
(5) When considering whether to make an access restriction order in relation to the
relevant service, and when considering what provision it should contain, the
court must take into account (amongst other things) the rights and obligations
of all relevant parties, including those of—
(a) the non-compliant provider,
(b) the person or persons on whom the court is considering imposing the
requirements, and
(c) United Kingdom users of the relevant service.
```
```
(6) An access restriction order made in relation to the relevant service must—
(a) identify the non-compliant provider,
(b) identify the persons on whom the requirements are imposed, and any
access facility to which the requirements relate,

place arrangements, to withdraw, adapt or manipulate the access
facility in order to impede users’ access (by means of that facility) to the
relevant service (or to part of it),
(d) specify the date by which the requirements in the order must be
complied with, and
(e) specify the date on which the order expires, or the time period for
which the order has effect.
```
```
(7) The steps that may be specified or arrangements that may be required to be put
in place—

of an agreement (whether or not made before the coming into force of
this section), or the prohibition of the performance of such an
agreement,
(b) are limited, so far as that is possible, to steps or arrangements that
impede the access of United Kingdom users, and

```
(8) OFCOM must inform the Secretary of State as soon as reasonably practicable
after an access restriction order has been made.
```
```
(9) Where a person who provides an access facility takes steps or puts in place
arrangements required by an access restriction order, OFCOM may, by notice,
require that person to (where possible) notify persons in the United Kingdom
who attempt to access the relevant service via that facility of the access
restriction order (and where a confirmation decision has been given to the non-
compliant provider, the notification must refer to that decision).
```
```
(10) For the purposes of this section, a facility is an “access facility” in relation to a
regulated service if the person who provides the facility is able to withdraw,
adapt or manipulate it in such a way as to impede access (by means of that
facility) to the regulated service (or to part of it) by United Kingdom users of
that service.

“interim access restriction order”) in relation to a regulated service where
OFCOM consider that—
(a) the grounds in section 92(3) or (4) apply in relation to the service, and
(b) either—
(i) a service restriction order under section 91 or an interim service
restriction order under section 92 has been made in relation to
the likely failure, and it was not sufficient to prevent significant
harm arising to individuals in the United Kingdom as a result
of the failure, or
(ii) the likely consequences of such a failure would be such that if a
service restriction order or an interim service restriction order
were to be made, it would be unlikely to be sufficient to prevent
significant harm arising to individuals in the United Kingdom
as a result of the failure,
and in this section, “the likely failure” means the likely failure
mentioned in section 92(3)(a) or (4)(a) (as the case may be).

mentioned in paragraph (d) provide an access facility in relation to the
relevant service, and specify any such access facility provided,
(f) specify the requirements which OFCOM consider that the order should

(g) in the case of an application made without notice having been given to
the non-compliant provider, or to the persons mentioned in paragraph
(d), state why no notice has been given.

(4) The court may make an interim access restriction order imposing requirements
on a person in relation to the relevant service if the court is satisfied—

in relation to the service,
(b) as to the ground in subsection (1)(b)(i) or (ii),
(c) that the person provides an access facility in relation to the relevant
service,
(d) that there are prima facie grounds to suggest that an application for an
access restriction order under section 93 would be successful,
(e) that the level of risk of harm to individuals in the United Kingdom
relating to the likely failure, and the nature and severity of that harm,
are such that it is not appropriate to wait for the failure to be established
before making the order, and
(f) if no notice of the application has been given to the non-compliant
provider, or to the persons on whom requirements are being imposed,
that it is appropriate to make the order without notice.

(6) Subsections (5) to (8) of section 93 apply in relation to an interim access
restriction order under this section as they apply in relation to an access
restriction order under that section.
```
```
(7) Where a person who provides an access facility takes steps or puts in place
arrangements required by an interim access restriction order, OFCOM may, by
notice, require that person to (where possible) notify persons in the United

Kingdom who attempt to access the relevant service via that facility of the
interim access restriction order.
```
```
(8) In this section, “access facility” and “the court” have the same meaning as in
