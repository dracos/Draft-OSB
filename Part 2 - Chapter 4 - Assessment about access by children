#### CHAPTER 4

#### ASSESSMENT ABOUT ACCESS BY CHILDREN

**26 Assessment about access by children**

```
(1) A provider of a regulated service must, at a time set out in section 27, carry out
an assessment—
(a) to determine whether it is possible for children to access the service or
any part of the service, and
(b) if it is possible for children to access the service or any part of the
service, to determine whether the child user condition is met in relation
to the service or any part of the service.
```
```
(2) If a provider provides more than one regulated service, an assessment under
subsection (1) must be carried out for each service separately.
```
```
(3) A provider is only entitled to conclude that it is not possible for children to
access a service, or a part of it, if there are systems or processes in place that


achieve the result that children are not normally able to access the service or
that part of it.
```
```
(4) The “child user condition” is met in relation to a service, or a part of a service,
if—
(a) there are a significant number of children who are users of the service
or of that part of it, or
(b) the service, or that part of it, is of a kind likely to attract a significant
number of users who are children.
```
```
(5) For the purposes of this Part, a service is to be treated as “likely to be accessed
by children” if the provider’s assessment of the service concludes that—
(a) it is possible for children to access the service or any part of it, and
(b) the child user condition is met in relation to—
(i) the service, or
(ii) a part of the service that it is possible for children to access.
```
```
(6) If a service is not treated as “likely to be accessed by children” for the purposes
of this Part, the provider must carry out a further assessment under this
section—
(a) before making any significant change to any aspect of the design or
operation of the service,
(b) in response to evidence about reduced effectiveness of any systems or
processes that are in place as mentioned in subsection (3), or
(c) in response to evidence about a significant increase in the number of
children using the service.
```
```
(7) A provider must keep written records of every assessment under this section.
```
```
(8) If a provider fails to carry out an assessment of a service as required by this
section, that service is to be treated as “likely to be accessed by children” for the
purposes of this Part until such time as the provider carries out an assessment.
```
```
(9) For the purposes of subsection (4)—
(a) the reference to a “significant” number includes a reference to a number
which is significant in proportion to the total number of United
Kingdom users of a service or (as the case may be) a part of a service;
(b) whether the test in paragraph (a) of that subsection is met is to be based
on evidence about who actually uses a service, rather than who the
intended users of the service are.
```
```
(10) In this section references to children are to children in the United Kingdom.
```
**27 Timing of assessment under section 26**

```
(1) In the case of a regulated service which is in operation immediately before the
day on which OFCOM first publish guidance under section 28, an assessment
must be carried out within the period of three months beginning with that day,
unless extra time is allowed by agreement with OFCOM.
```
```
(2) In the case of a regulated service which begins operating on or after the day
referred to in subsection (1), an assessment must be carried out before United
Kingdom users are able to access the service.

(3) In the case of a user-to-user service or search service which, having previously
not been a regulated service, becomes a regulated service, an assessment must
be carried out—
(a) before United Kingdom users are able to access the service, or
(b) if such users were already able to access the service, as soon as
reasonably practicable after the service becomes a regulated service.
```
```
(4) In this section “assessment” means an assessment under section 26(1).
```
```
(5) In its application to a service not yet accessed by United Kingdom users,
section 26 is to be read with the necessary modifications.
```
**28 OFCOM’s guidance about assessments under section 26**

```
(1) OFCOM must prepare guidance for providers of regulated services to assist
them in complying with their duties to carry out assessments under section 26.
```
```
(2) OFCOM must publish the guidance (and any revised or replacement
guidance).
```
