#### EXPLANATORY NOTES FOR THIS SECTION

Part 3: Other Duties of Service Providers
Chapter 1: Transparency Reports

Clause 49: Transparency reports by service providers

This clause requires providers of relevant services to publish annual
transparency reports and sets out OFCOM’s powers in relation to these reports. The
information set out in transparency reports will help ensure that users are able to
understand the steps providers are taking to keep them safe, and will furnish
OFCOM with the information required to hold them to account where needed.
Subsection (1) requires providers of relevant services to produce annual
transparency reports. This report must contain the information of a kind specified by
OFCOM in a notice given to the provider, in the format specified by OFCOM, and
must be submitted by a date specified by OFCOM and published in the manner and
by the deadline given by OFCOM.
Subsection (2) requires providers of relevant services to ensure that the
information in their transparency reports is complete and accurate.
Subsection (3) provides that only Category 1, Category 2A and Category 2B
services will be classified as “relevant services”, and thus only providers of these
services will be required to produce annual transparency reports. The subsection
also signposts to clause 59(6) for more information on the definitions of Category 1,
Category 2A and Category 2B services.
Subsection (4) specifies the types of information that OFCOM will be able to
require providers of relevant services to include in their transparency reports. This
could include, for example, information about the incidence of harmful content on a
provider’s service and the processes enabling users to report such content. The
subsection describes high-level types of information in order to allow OFCOM the
flexibility to tailor the exact information it will require to the relevant service in
question. Moreover, in order to ensure that the types of information that can be
required remain relevant to a fast-changing online safety landscape, subsection (7)
permits the Secretary of State, having consulted OFCOM, to amend the types of
information listed in subsection (4) by regulations.
Subsection (5) sets out various factors that OFCOM must take into account
when deciding which types of information to require under subsection (4). These
include the service provider’s capacity to produce information, the type of service and
the functionalities the service offers, the number of UK users of the service and the
proportion of UK users who are children. These factors are designed to help OFCOM
to select the most appropriate and proportionate types of information to require from
the service provider in question
Subsection (6) grants the Secretary of State the power to change (via
regulations) the frequency with which providers of relevant services are required to
produce transparency reports. The Secretary of State must consult OFCOM before
making regulations under this subsection (subsection (8)).
These explanatory notes relate to the Online Safety Bill as published in draft on 12 May 2021 (Bill CP 405)
Subsection (7) grants the Secretary of State the power to change (via
regulations) the kinds of information that OFCOM can require a provider of a relevant
service to include in its transparency report under subsection (4), and the factors that
OFCOM must take into account under subsection (5) in deciding which kinds of
information to require. The Secretary of State must consult OFCOM before making
regulations under this subsection (subsection (8)).
Subsection (9) signposts to the meanings of the terms “content that is harmful
to adults”, “content that is harmful to children” and “illegal content”.
Clause 50: Transparency reports: guidance

This clause places a requirement on OFCOM to prepare guidance on how it
will exercise its powers relating to transparency reports (clause 49) and to consult on
and publish this guidance.
Subsection (1) places a duty on OFCOM to prepare guidance detailing, for
example, how it will decide what types of information (from the list in clause 49(4)) it
will require providers of relevant services to include in their transparency reports,
describing how information from provider’s transparency reports will be used in
drawing up OFCOM’s transparency report, and anything else that OFCOM deems
relevant to the production and publication of providers’ transparency reports and its
own transparency report.
Subsection (2) sets out a list of people whom OFCOM must consult before
preparing guidance, if OFCOM considers it appropriate to consult that person.
Subsection (3) requires OFCOM to publish the first version of the guidance,
as well as any later versions of the guidance.
Subsection (4) says that in exercising its functions under section 49 or 100,
OFCOM must have regard to the guidance for the time being in force under this
section.
Subsection (5) notes that the term “relevant service” means the same thing in
this clause as it does in clause 49.
Chapter 2: Fees

Clause 51: Duty to notify OFCOM

This clause specifies that providers with qualifying worldwide revenue at or
above a specified threshold will have an obligation to notify OFCOM and pay an
annual fee, as described in clause 52. Where providers whose qualifying worldwide
revenue is at or above the threshold do not notify or pay a fee, then enforcement
action may be taken against them as provided for in clauses 88 and 89.
These explanatory notes relate to the Online Safety Bill as published in draft on 12 May 2021 (Bill CP 405)
Subsection (1) specifies that a provider must notify OFCOM for the first
charging year that the provider is required to pay a fee. This may be the initial
charging year or a subsequent charging year. The provider must also notify OFCOM
where they believe they are no longer liable to pay a fee.
Subsection (2) clarifies that a “fee paying year’’ for a provider means a
charging year where the provider is not exempt from paying a fee, and where their
qualifying worldwide revenue for the relevant time period is at, or above, the
threshold set by OFCOM for that year.
Subsection (3) specifies that at the point of notification, the provider must
share with OFCOM:
a. details of the regulated service(s) they provide;
b. its qualifying worldwide revenue for the relevant time period; and
c. any other relevant information requested by OFCOM and specified in
OFCOM’s Statement of Charging Principles (i.e. the document issued
annually by OFCOM which includes key information on how funding is
allocated to OFCOM itself and what principles are followed in determining
fees to be charged): see clause 55.
Subsection (4) clarifies that providers will need to notify OFCOM within
timeframes detailed in OFCOM’s Statement of Charging Principles.
Subsection (5) allows for OFCOM to exempt particular descriptions of
providers from these notification requirements and the duty to pay a fee as described
in clause 52. The exemption must be approved by the Secretary of State.
Subsection (6) allows for OFCOM to revoke any exemption specified in
subsection (5), as long as the revocation has been approved by the Secretary of
State.
Subsection (7) requires that OFCOM must publish details of any exemption
approved under subsection (5).
Subsection (8) gives the Secretary of State the power to make regulations to
define “qualifying worldwide review” and “qualifying period”.
Subsection (9) requires that the Secretary of State consult OFCOM before
making the regulations under subsection (8).
Subsection (10) clarifies that for the purposes of notification and payment of
an annual fee, a “provider of a regulated service” can include providers who have
been providing a service for either the entire year, or part of the year.
Subsection (11) defines “charging year’’ and “initial charging year’’.
Clause 52: Duty to pay fees

These explanatory notes relate to the Online Safety Bill as published in draft on 12 May 2021 (Bill CP 405)
This clause sets out the factors taken into account by OFCOM when
determining which regulated services are required to pay the fee, and the level of the
fee to be paid.
Subsection (1) enables OFCOM to charge a fee to providers of a regulated
service so long as the provider is not exempt and the provider’s qualifying worldwide
revenue is at or above the specified threshold.
Subsection (2) details the factors taken into account when determining the fee
payable by a regulated service provider. OFCOM will set the fee payable by a
provider taking into account the qualifying worldwide revenue for the charging year
and any other factors deemed appropriate.
Subsection (3) clarifies that in the event of a disagreement between OFCOM
and the provider, OFCOM shall determine the fee (or instalment) payable and/or the
qualifying worldwide revenue attributable to the relevant period.
Subsection (4) references the requirement for OFCOM to determine the fees
payable in line with their Statement of Charging Principles: see clause 55.
Subsection (5) clarifies that, should a provider only be in scope for part of the
charging year, OFCOM has the power to refund all or part of the fee paid by that
provider.
Subsection (6) is self-explanatory and states that “charging year’’, ‘’fee-paying
year’’, “qualifying period’’, and “qualifying worldwide revenue’’ have the same
meaning as under clause 51.
Clause 53: Threshold figure

This clause details the process to be followed when determining the threshold
at, or above which, providers will be required to notify and pay an annual fee (see
clauses 51 and 52).
Subsection (1) specifies that OFCOM must determine the appropriate
threshold figure. First, OFCOM must propose a figure to the Secretary of State: see
subsection (2).
Then, the Secretary of State must decide whether or not to approve the
proposed threshold figure put forward by OFCOM: see subsection (3).
If the Secretary of State approves the threshold figure for fees, they must
inform OFCOM and OFCOM must then publish the threshold figure: see subsection
(3). If the Secretary of State does not approve the threshold figure for fees, they must
inform OFCOM and then the Secretary of State must determine, and subsequently
publish, a threshold figure that they consider appropriate: see subsection (4).
Subsection (5) requires OFCOM to keep the threshold figure under review. If
OFCOM considers that the figure should be amended, the steps set out under
subsections (1)-(4) of this clause will need to be undertaken again.
These explanatory notes relate to the Online Safety Bill as published in draft on 12 May 2021 (Bill CP 405)
Subsection (6) requires the first threshold figure to be published prior to the
start of the initial charging year when fees become payable.
Subsection (7) defines “initial charging year”.
Clause 54: Secretary of State’s guidance

This clause sets out the requirement for the Secretary of State to issue
guidance relating to fees and the threshold.
Subsection (1) references the requirement for the Secretary of State to issue
guidance to OFCOM setting out principles to be considered when determining fees
payable under clause 52. The guidance must also set out the principles to be
considered by OFCOM when determining the threshold figure under clause 53. The
Secretary of State must lay the guidance before Parliament (see subsection (4)) and
publish it: see subsection (5).
Before issuing, revising or replacing the fees and threshold guidance, the
Secretary of State must consult OFCOM: see subsection (2). The guidance may not
be revised or replaced more frequently than once every three years unless this is
agreed by the Secretary of State and OFCOM or it needs to be corrected as a result
of subsequent changes to the fee provisions in the Bill: subsection (3).
Subsection (6) states that OFCOM is required to have regard to the fees
guidance when exercising its functions relating to fees under this Chapter.
Clause 55: Fees statements by OFCOM

This clause details the process for OFCOM to publish a Statement of
Charging Principles. This clause covers the information that should be included in the
Statement, how OFCOM must make or amend the Statement, and how OFCOM
should make interested persons aware of the Statement.
Subsection (1) requires OFCOM to publish a Statement of Charging
Principles outlining the principles which OFCOM will adhere to when setting the fees
payable. Without publication of this document OFCOM is not permitted to require
providers to pay a fee.
Subsection (2) sets out the content of OFCOM’s Statement of Charging
Principles. This Statement must outline how the fees charged by OFCOM will meet,
but not exceed, the costs of carrying out online safety functions. It must also set out
how the fees to be charged to providers are proportionate and justifiable and that
there is transparency in relation to the costs incurred and fees charged.
Subsection (3) outlines a requirement for the Statement of Charging
Principles to include detail on how fees payable under clause 52 are calculated.
Subsection (4) sets out a requirement for OFCOM to consult those likely to be
affected by the Statement of Charging Principles prior to making or revising the
Statement. Those likely to be consulted will include providers with services in scope
of the framework.
These explanatory notes relate to the Online Safety Bill as published in draft on 12 May 2021 (Bill CP 405)

Subsection (5) sets out the requirement for OFCOM to bring the Statement of
Charging Principles to the attention of those likely to be affected by it by publishing
the Statement in such a way as it considers appropriate.
Subsection (6) explains that after the end of each charging year, OFCOM
must publish a document which sets out: the total amounts of the fees payable that
were received by OFCOM; the total amount of fees that remain outstanding; and
OFCOM’s total costs of carrying out its online safety functions.
Subsection (7) sets out the requirement for any deficit or surplus identified
under subsection (6) to be carried forward and taken into account when determining
the fees payable for the following year.
Subsection (8) clarifies that “OFCOM’s costs” include costs incurred by
OFCOM in preparing to carry out their online safety functions during a charging year.
Subsection (8)(b) clarifies that “OFCOM’s costs” also include preparatory costs
incurred after clause 55 comes into force but before the initial charging year. Those
costs incurred when preparing to carry out the online safety functions, after clause 55
comes into force, should be treated as if they were incurred in the initial charging
year.
Subsection (9) states that “charging year” has the same meaning as that in
clause 51.
