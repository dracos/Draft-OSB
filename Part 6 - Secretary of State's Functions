#### EXPLANATORY NOTES FOR THIS SECTION

Part 6: Secretary of State’s Functions in Relation to Regulated Services
Strategic Priorities

Clause 109: Statement of strategic priorities

This clause introduces a power for the Secretary of State to designate and
publish a statement of strategic priorities in relation to online safety matters, and the
promotion of media literacy where this is relevant to online safety. The statement will
allow the government to set out the overall strategic direction for tackling online
harms and respond at a high level to future changes. This power is similar to the
existing power the Secretary of State has in the Communications Act 2003 in relation
to telecommunications, management of radio spectrum and postal services.
Subsection (1) specifies that in order to designate a statement of strategic
priorities, the Secretary of State must first consult and follow the parliamentary
procedure set out in clause 110.
Subsection (3) provides that the statement may specify particular outcomes to
deliver the strategic priorities. For example, the Secretary of State may set a target
eradication rate for child sexual exploitation and abuse (CSEA) images online or look
to reduce regulatory burdens on companies.
Subsections (6) to (8) make provision for the amendment of a statement of
strategic priorities in whole or in part, by the issuing of a subsequent statement.
There are limited circumstances in which amendments may be made within a five
year period, including where there has been a significant change in government
policy affecting online safety matters.
Clause 110: Consultation and parliamentary procedure

This clause sets out the consultation and parliamentary procedure
requirements that must be satisfied before the Secretary of State can designate a
statement of strategic priorities under clause 109.
Subsection (2) states that the Secretary of State must consult OFCOM and
other persons the Secretary of State considers appropriate on a draft of the
statement. For example, the Secretary of State may wish to consult other
government departments, industry bodies, academics, policy institutes/think tanks, or
other regulators.
Subsection (3) provides for a period of at least 40 days for such consultation
with OFCOM, following which the Secretary of State must make any changes to the
draft statement that appear necessary to the Secretary of State and then lay the draft
statement before Parliament (subsection (4)).
Subsection (5) specifies that the Secretary of State must wait for the 40-day
period after laying the draft statement to expire before designating it. The statement
cannot be designated if either House of Parliament resolves not to approve the draft
statement during that 40-day period.
These explanatory notes relate to the Online Safety Bill as published in draft on 12 May 2021 (Bill CP 405)
Directions to OFCOM

Clause 111: Secretary of State directions about advisory committees

This clause enables the Secretary of State to give OFCOM a direction to
establish an expert committee to give advice to OFCOM about the online safety
matters which the Secretary of State has specified in the direction.
The Secretary of State must consult OFCOM before issuing a direction, and
can vary or revoke the direction at any time. For example, this power could be used
in a scenario where there is growing concern around the understanding of members
of the public on the impact of social media on societal polarisation. It is unlikely that
the duty of care alone, which is limited to harm to individuals, would address this
issue. In consultation with OFCOM, the Secretary of State could direct OFCOM to
establish an advisory committee to facilitate multi-stakeholder dialogue and build a
greater understanding of the issue.
Subsection (3) sets out that OFCOM must appoint a committee chair, and
that the number of members apart from the chair is at OFCOM’s discretion, unless
the direction specifies otherwise.
Subsection (4) places a duty on an advisory committee established under this
direction to publish a report within 18 months of it being established, and to report
periodically after that, unless the direction specifies otherwise.
Clause 112: Secretary of State directions in special circumstances

This clause enables the Secretary of State to give OFCOM directions in
circumstances where they consider there is a threat to the health or safety of the
public, or to national security. This includes directing OFCOM to prioritise action to
respond to such a specific threat when exercising its media literacy functions and to
require a service provider to publicly report on what steps it is taking to respond to
that threat.
Subsection (1) specifies the circumstances under which the Secretary of
State is able to issue directions under this clause, where the Secretary of State has
reasonable grounds to believe there is a threat to the health or safety of the public, or
to national security.
Subsection (2) provides that the Secretary of State can direct OFCOM to give
priority for a specified period to specified objectives regarding OFCOM’s duty to
promote media literacy, as set out in section 11 of the Communications Act 2003, in
relation to broadcasting and electronic media. This provides the Secretary of State
with the option to step in to ensure that OFCOM is taking steps to address threats of
disinformation and misinformation.
Subsection (3) provides that the Secretary of State can direct OFCOM to
issue a public statement notice that requires providers of a regulated service to set
These explanatory notes relate to the Online Safety Bill as published in draft on 12 May 2021 (Bill CP 405)
out the steps the provider is taking in response to the threat presented to the health
or safety of the public, or to national security.
Subsection (6) specifies that the Secretary of State must publish the reasons
for giving a direction related to OFCOM’s media literacy priorities or to require
OFCOM to give a public notice statement to service providers in circumstances
where there is a threat to the health or safety of the public. There is an exception to
the requirement of publishing the reasons for giving a direction where it relates to a
threat to national security, the Secretary of State can vary or revoke a direction at
any time. If so, OFCOM can vary or revoke the public statement notice it has given
pursuant to the Secretary of State’s direction: see subsection (7) and (8).
Guidance

Clause 113: Secretary of State guidance

This clause enables the Secretary of State to give guidance to OFCOM
relating to OFCOM’s exercise of its statutory powers and functions. The guidance will
provide clarity to OFCOM and others about how the Secretary of State expects
OFCOM to carry out its statutory functions. The Secretary of State must consult
OFCOM before issuing new guidance, or revising or replacing guidance: see
subsection (3). The Secretary of State must also publish any new, revised or
replacement guidance and lay it in Parliament: see subsections (6) and (7).
Subsection (1) states that the Secretary of State may give guidance to
OFCOM about the exercise of its functions under the Online Safety Bill. The
Secretary of State may also give guidance on the exercise of OFCOM’s general
powers and its media literacy functions under the Communications Act 2003.
Subsection (2) exempts guidance to OFCOM about fees and guidance about
OFCOM’s media literacy functions in relation to services other than regulated
services from the definition of ‘the guidance’, thereby excluding the requirements of
subsections (3) to (8) from applying to such guidance.
Subsection (4) states that the guidance should not be revised more frequently
than every three years, save for if one of the following two exceptions applies:
a. The guidance needs to be amended as a result of a change to the Online
Safety Act or to the media literacy provisions in the Communications Act
2003.
b. There is agreement between OFCOM and the Secretary of State that the
guidance should be revised or replaced.
Subsection (5) requires the guidance to be issued as one document.
Subsection (8) sets out OFCOM’s responsibilities in relation to the guidance.
Namely, OFCOM must have regard to the guidance when exercising any functions to
which the guidance relates or when considering whether or not to exercise such
functions.
These explanatory notes relate to the Online Safety Bill as published in draft on 12 May 2021 (Bill CP 405)
Annual Report

Clause 114: Annual report on the Secretary of State’s functions

Section 390 of the Communications Act 2003 requires the Secretary of State
to prepare and lay before Parliament annual reports about the performance of their
functions under specific legislation, including the Communications Act 2003, the
Office of Communications Act 2002 and the Broadcasting Acts 1990 and 1996.
This clause amends the Communications Act 2003 by adding the functions
under this Bill to the list of functions which the Secretary of State must include in their
annual report to Parliament.
Review

Clause 115: Review

This clause provides for a review to be undertaken by the Secretary of State,
published and laid before Parliament, between 2 and 5 years after the duties on
services in Part 2 are commenced in order to assess the effectiveness of the
regulatory framework. The timing requirement (subclause (2)) is designed to ensure
there is adequate time to allow the regime to be in operation before the review takes
place, and that a review will take place in a timely manner.
Subsection (1) sets the scope of the review to the operation of (a) the
regulatory framework under the Online Safety Act and (b) section 11 of the
Communications Act 2003 (duty to promote media literacy) to the extent that that
section relates to online safety matters.
Subsection (3) specifies some of the areas the review must consider in
assessing the effectiveness of the regulatory framework. This includes the impact of
the systems and processes regulated services have put in place, and whether the
regulation of services is proportionate.
Subsection (4) specifies further areas that must be considered as part of the
review. These are the effectiveness of OFCOM’s information gathering, information
sharing and enforcement powers; the extent to which OFCOM has had regard to the
desirability of encouraging innovation; and whether it would be appropriate for
OFCOM to be able to exercise the power to require that a provider name a senior
manager in their response to an information notice (clause 71), in light of the
effectiveness of OFCOM’s power to require information using an information notice
(clause 70).
