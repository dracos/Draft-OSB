**63 Use of technology warning notice**

```
(1) OFCOM may, in accordance with this section, give a notice (a “use of
technology warning notice”) to a provider of a regulated service stating that
OFCOM intend to give the provider a use of technology notice under—
(a) in the case of a user-to-user service, section 64;
(b) in the case of a search service, section 65.
```
```
(2) OFCOM may give a use of technology warning notice relating to a regulated
user-to-user service to the provider of the service if they consider that there are
reasonable grounds for believing that the provider is failing to comply with the
duty in section 9 (safety duties about illegal content), so far as relating to
terrorism content or CSEA content (or both those kinds of content), based on
evidence demonstrating—
(a) the prevalence, and
(b) the persistent presence,
of terrorism content or CSEA content or both (as the case may be) on the service
in question.

(3) OFCOM may give a use of technology warning notice relating to a regulated
search service to the provider of the service if they consider that there are
reasonable grounds for believing that the provider is failing to comply with the
duty in section 21 (safety duties about illegal content), so far as relating to
terrorism content or CSEA content (or both those kinds of content), based on
evidence demonstrating—
(a) the prevalence, and
(b) the persistent presence,
of terrorism content or CSEA content or both (as the case may be) in search
results of the service in question.
```
```
(4) A use of technology warning notice given to a provider must—
(a) give OFCOM’s reasons for their opinion that the provider is failing to
comply with the duty referred to in subsection (2) or (3) (as the case
may be),
(b) contain details of the technology that OFCOM are considering
requiring the provider to use,
(c) specify whether the technology is to be required in relation to terrorism
content or CSEA content (or both),
(d) specify any other requirements that OFCOM are considering imposing
(see section 64(6) and (7) or section 65(6) and (7)), and
(e) specify the period for which OFCOM are considering imposing the
requirements (see section 66(2)).
```
```
(5) A use of technology warning notice given to a provider must—
(a) state that the provider may make written representations (with any
supporting evidence) about the matters contained in the notice, and
(b) specify the period within which such representations may be made.
```
```
(6) A use of technology warning notice may be given in respect of any period
during which the failure to comply with the duty referred to in subsection (2)
or (3) has continued, and must specify that period.
```
**64 Use of technology notice: user-to-user service**

```
(1) This section applies if—
(a) a use of technology warning notice under section 63 relating to a
particular regulated user-to-user service has been given to the provider
of that service, and
(b) the period allowed for representations has expired.
```
```
(2) If, after considering any representations and evidence, OFCOM decide not to
give a use of technology notice to the provider, they must inform the provider
of that fact.
```
```
(3) If the conditions mentioned in subsection (5) are met, OFCOM may give the
provider a use of technology notice under this section.
```
```
(4) A use of technology notice under this section is a notice relating to a regulated
user-to-user service requiring the provider of the service to do either or both of
the following—
(a) use accredited technology to identify public terrorism content present
on the service and to swiftly take down that content (either by means of
the technology alone or by means of the technology together with the


use of human moderators to review terrorism content identified by the
technology);
(b) use accredited technology to identify CSEA content present on any part
of the service (public or private), and to swiftly take down that content
(either by means of the technology alone or by means of the technology
together with the use of human moderators to review CSEA content
identified by the technology).
```
```
(5) The conditions which must be met in relation to the service are as follows—
(a) OFCOM have evidence demonstrating—
(i) the prevalence, and
(ii) the persistent presence,
of terrorism content or CSEA content or both (as the case may be) on the
service,
(b) OFCOM are satisfied that no less intrusive step than the use of the
technology to be specified in the notice is likely to achieve the necessary
reduction in terrorism content or CSEA content present on the service,
and
(c) OFCOM are satisfied that giving the notice is a proportionate means of
addressing the problem of terrorism content or CSEA content present
on the service.
```
```
(6) If a provider is already using accredited technology in relation to the service in
question, a use of technology notice under this section may require the
provider to use it more effectively (specifying the ways in which that must be
done).
```
```
(7) A use of technology notice under this section may also require a provider to
operate an effective complaints procedure allowing for United Kingdom users
to challenge the take down of content which they have generated, uploaded or
shared on the service.
```
```
(8) For the purposes of subsection (4)(a) terrorism content is “public” if it is
generated, uploaded or shared on the service in question publicly, and a use of
technology notice relating to terrorism content must identify the content, or
parts of the service that include content, that OFCOM reasonably consider
meets that description in the case of that service.
```
```
(9) OFCOM may vary or revoke a use of technology notice under this section by a
further notice under this section.
```
**65 Use of technology notice: search service**

```
(1) This section applies if—
(a) a use of technology warning notice under section 63 relating to a
particular regulated search service has been given to the provider of
that service, and
(b) the period allowed for representations has expired.
```
```
(2) If, after considering any representations and evidence, OFCOM decide not to
give a use of technology notice to the provider, they must inform the provider
of that fact.
```
```
(3) If the conditions mentioned in subsection (5) are met, OFCOM may give the
provider a use of technology notice under this section.


(4) A use of technology notice under this section is a notice relating to a regulated
search service requiring the provider of the service to do either or both of the
following—
(a) use accredited technology to identify terrorism content in search results
and to swiftly take steps that result in that content no longer appearing
in search results (either by means of the technology alone or by means
of the technology together with the use of human moderators to review
terrorism content identified by the technology);
(b) use accredited technology to identify CSEA content in search results
and to swiftly take steps that result in that content no longer appearing
in search results (either by means of the technology alone or by means
of the technology together with the use of human moderators to review
CSEA content identified by the technology).
```
```
(5) The conditions which must be met in relation to the service are as follows—
(a) OFCOM have evidence demonstrating—
(i) the prevalence, and
(ii) the persistent presence,
of terrorism content or CSEA content or both (as the case may be) in
search results of the service,
(b) OFCOM are satisfied that no less intrusive step than the use of the
technology to be specified in the notice is likely to achieve the necessary
reduction in terrorism content or CSEA content in search results of the
service, and
(c) OFCOM are satisfied that giving the notice is a proportionate means of
addressing the problem of terrorism content or CSEA content in search
results of the service.
```
```
(6) If a provider is already using accredited technology in relation to the service in
question, a use of technology notice under this section may require the
provider to use it more effectively (specifying the ways in which that must be
done).
```
```
(7) A use of technology notice under this section may also require a provider to
operate an effective complaints procedure allowing for an interested person to
challenge steps taken by the provider that have resulted in content relating to
that interested person no longer appearing in search results.
```
```
(8) OFCOM may vary or revoke a use of technology notice under this section by a
further notice under this section.
```
**66 Use of technology notices: supplementary**

```
(1) A use of technology notice must—
(a) give OFCOM’s reasons for their decision to give the notice,
(b) contain details of the requirements imposed by the notice,
(c) contain details of the technology to be used,
(d) specify the day by which the notice must be complied with, and the
period for which it is to have effect,
(e) contain details of the rights of appeal under section 105,
(f) contain information about when OFCOM intend to review the notice
(see section 67), and

(g) contain information about the consequences of not complying with the
notice (including information about the further kinds of enforcement
action that it would be open to OFCOM to take).
```
```
(2) A use of technology notice may impose requirements for a period of up to 36
months beginning with the day specified in the notice as the day by which the
notice must be complied with.
```
```
(3) A use of technology notice may impose requirements only in relation to the
operation of a regulated service—
(a) in the United Kingdom, or
(b) as it affects United Kingdom users of the service.
```
```
(4) For the purposes of sections 64 and 65, technology is “accredited” if it is
accredited (by OFCOM or another person appointed by OFCOM) as meeting
minimum standards of accuracy in the detection of terrorism content or CSEA
content (as the case may be).
```
```
(5) Those minimum standards of accuracy must be such standards as are for the
time being approved and published by the Secretary of State, following advice
from OFCOM.
```
```
(6) In this section “use of technology notice” means a use of technology notice
under section 64 or 65.
```
**67 Further use of technology notice**

```
(1) This section applies where OFCOM have given a provider of a regulated
service a use of technology notice under section 64 or 65.
```
```
(2) If, at any time during the period for which the notice has effect—
(a) there are reasonable grounds for believing that the provider is failing to
comply with the notice, and
(b) the conditions for giving a use of technology notice, as set out in section
64(5) or 65(5) (whichever applies), are still met in relation to the service
in question,
OFCOM may revoke the notice and give the provider a further use of
technology notice under this section.
```
```
(3) Except where the use of technology notice is revoked under subsection (2),
OFCOM must, before the end of the period for which the notice has effect,
carry out a review of the use of the specified technology by the provider in
relation to the service in question.
```
```
(4) The review must consider—
(a) the extent to which the specified technology has been used, and
(b) the effectiveness of its use.
```
```
(5) Following the review, and after consultation with the provider, OFCOM may
give the provider a further use of technology notice under this section if
OFCOM reasonably consider that there is a significant risk that, without the
continued use of accredited technology, terrorism content or CSEA content (or
both) will be prevalent, and persistently present—
(a) in the case of a user-to-user service, on the service;
(b) in the case of a search service, in search results of the service.
```
```
(6) If a further use of technology notice is given, subsections (2) to (5) apply again.
